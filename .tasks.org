* Org mcp
  Org mcp is a server that allows ai agents to interact with an emacs org file.
  This allows both a programmer and an Ai agent to work on a shared document that delegates tasks.

** Headers
   The main structure of an org file is the tree of headers that will encapsulate common items in a directory like structure.
   A header supports a lot of metadata like progress counters, schedules or even a properties dictionairy.

** Bullets
   Bullets are a substructure of a header that can include distinct tasks needed to complete a task specified by a header.
   Bullets can have checkboxes associated with either a space to mark uncompleted a dash as partially completed or x for completed.

*** DONE Bullet parsing
*** PROG Bullet modification [2/4]
**** DONE bullet creation
**** DONE bullet completion
**** PROG bullet deletion [2/4]
     DEADLINE: <2025-11-08 Sat>
     - [X] Implement bullet deletion function.
     - [X] Integrate bullet deletion in the bullet createion mcp tool.
     - [ ] Write unit tests for bullet deletion.
     - [ ] Test the MCP tool for correctness of execution and return values.
**** TODO synchornise header progress
     - [X] Parially done already with the `CheckProgress` function
     - [ ] Change header status automatically from =NEXT=/=TODO= to =PROG=
     - [ ] Test new functionality

*** NEXT Plain text parsing [0/6]
    SCHEDULED: <2025-11-08 sat>
    - [ ] Extend the =ParseIndentedLine= function so it has a fallback to anything other than bullets etc.
    - [ ] Add a =Text= type that implements =Render=
    - [ ] Assign the default path of the switch case in =ParseIndentedLine= to a =Text= renderable.
    - [ ] Unit test =Text= parsing
    - [ ] Unit test rendering of =Text=
    - [ ] Test the MCP integration by fetching a header and checking whether the plain text is returned as well.
